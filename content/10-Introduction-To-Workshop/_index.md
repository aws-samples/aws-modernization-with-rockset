## Introduction 

The goal of the workshop is to build a real-time dashboard.  In this workshop, we will be simulating real-time transactions that’ll be stored in DynamoDB, analyzed on Rockset, and visualized on Grafana. 


<h4>  This workshop will have 2 segments </h4> 

1. **Guided workshop on building real-time dashboards**: We’ll be using DynamoDB, S3, Rockset, and Grafana to build real-time dashboards.
 
1. **Mini-hackathon**:  The second half of the workshop will be a live 60 min hackathon where you will be randomly partnered to continue building out the real-time dashboards. Your team will be given 3 prompts to answer. Once finished, you’ll have a chance to build other real-time applications like real-time leaderboards, real-time personalization, and more!  For example, which car company had the most transactions? Or, how do you personalize results based on the users’ click data?

It’s your choice on what you want to build. At the end of the hackathon, your teams will do mini-presentations and prizes.

**NOTE**: Need more ideas on what real-time apps to build?  We can brainstorm more during the workshop or feel free to contribute to [Q&A section](https://community.rockset.com/c/open-q-and-a/29) on the [Rockset Community](https://community.rockset.com/)!
