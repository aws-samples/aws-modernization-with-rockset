## Welcome to the AWS-Rockset Real-time Analytics on DynamoDB Workshop

DynamoDB is one of the most popular, cloud-native NoSQL databases. Unlike a traditional relational database management system (RDBMS), DynamoDB scales horizontally, obviating the need for careful capacity planning, resharding, and database maintenance. As a result, DynamoDB is the database of choice for companies building event-driven architectures and user-friendly, performant applications at scale. As such, DynamoDB is central to many modern applications in ad tech, gaming, IoT, and financial services.

Rockset Pairs with DynamoDB for Complex Analytics
DynamoDB is great for real-time transactions and it can be paired with Rockset for analytical workloads, like complex aggregations and JOINs. Rockset is a real-time analytics database that’s able to ingest data with a latency of 1 - 2 seconds and execute heavy analytical SQL queries (with JOINs!) in milliseconds. When data is ingested from DynamoDB,  it’s indexed via Rockset’s Converged Index™, so terabytes of deeply nested data are queryable in under a second. Rockset indexes all fields in the document 3 different ways: a row index, columnar index, and an inverted index.  Rockset also supports real-time updates, inserts, and deletes.  

Watch the recorded live session of how you can do complex analytics with DynamoDB and Rockset below!
