## CREATE REAL-TIME DASHBOARDS USING GRAFANA

For this workshop, you’ll have an EC2 instance already set up with Grafana installed. If you’re doing this outside the workshop and running the Cloudformation template, you’ll set up the EC2 instance yourself.
In order to get started, you’ll install the Rockset plugin and restart the Grafana server. Please follow the directions below to launch Grafana with the Rockset plugin in the the next slide.
